# Git Workflow for Machine Learning Projects

## Overview

This repository demonstrates my proficiency in using Git for version control in machine learning projects. It showcases a practical workflow I've developed and implemented in real-world scenarios, emphasizing best practices for collaborative development and project management.

## Key Features

- Structured Git workflow tailored for ML projects
- Branch management strategy for feature development
- Commit practices for clear project history
- Integration of version control with ML project lifecycle

## Workflow Highlights

### 1. Project Initialization

I begin each project by setting up a clean Git repository:

```bash
mkdir ml_new_project
cd ml_new_project/
git init
git config --global user.name "Felipe Leite"
git config --global user.email "felipe.nog.leite@gmail.com"
```

This ensures a consistent starting point across all team members.

### 2. Feature Development

For each new feature or model iteration, I create a dedicated branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/new_model
```

This allows for isolated development without affecting the main codebase.

### 3. Commit Strategy

I use clear, descriptive commit messages to document progress:

```bash
git commit -m "Implement initial data preprocessing pipeline"
```

This practice maintains a comprehensible project history, crucial for long-term maintenance and collaboration.

### 4. Code Review and Merging

After feature completion, I merge changes back to the main branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feat/new_model
```

This step often involves code review, ensuring quality and knowledge sharing within the team.

### 5. Version Tagging

For significant milestones or releases, I use Git tags:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0 -m "First stable model release"
```

This helps in tracking major versions of our ML models.

## Real-World Application

In my projects, this workflow has proven invaluable for:

- Managing multiple model versions simultaneously
- Facilitating collaboration among data scientists and ML engineers
- Maintaining a clear history of model development and experiments
- Enabling easy rollbacks to previous stable versions if needed

## Conclusion

This Git workflow has been a cornerstone in my ML projects, enabling efficient collaboration, version control, and project management. It demonstrates my ability to integrate software development best practices with machine learning workflows, a critical skill in modern data science projects.
